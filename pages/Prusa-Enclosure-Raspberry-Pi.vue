          to include a Raspberry Pi 2. Rather than adding another box for the
          Raspberry Pi to go in, we wanted a clean, integrated solution: So here
          it is!

        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It should fit a Raspberry Pi 3 but we have not tested this. (If you
            do, please let us know!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Space within the enclosure is quite cramped, so connecting the wires
            to the Pi can be a bit, well, fiddly. We suggest you brew yourself a
            cup of tea before doing this. (Or

            with a higher case ðŸ˜‰)
          </li>
          <li>
            In our experience it is perfectly possible to power the Raspberry Pi
            from the Einsy Board, even when using the Multi Material Upgrade. If
            you are planning to power additional devices from the Pi however,
            consider adding a separate power adapter or upgrade the one that
            came with your printer.
          </li>
          <li>
            This design blocks the Piâ€™s power connector, so it needs to be
            powered via the 5V rail (Pins 2 and 6). Please be aware that other
            than the USB power connector, the rail does not feature a regulator
            or fuse. An incorrect voltage or current spike could fry the Pi. In
            all the time that we have used this setup, this has never been a
            problem. If you are concerned about this, be sure to add a fuse.
