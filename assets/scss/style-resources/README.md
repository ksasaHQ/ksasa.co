# STYLE RESOURCES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

SCSS variables and mixins from this directory are automatically made available to .vue components.

_Do not import actual styles._ Use this module only to import variables, mixins, functions (et cetera) as they won't exist in the actual build. Importing actual styles will include them in every component and will also make your build/HMR magnitudes slower. _Do not do this!_
